    "- In 1952 [Donald A. Glaser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_A._Glaser) invented a new tool for studying partical physics - the **[bubble chamber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_chamber)**. \n",
    "    - Glaser was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1960 for his invention.\n",
    "- The bubble chamber worked by tracing the bubbles formed by charged particles moving through a superheated liquid. \n",
    "- Physicists took pictures of the bubbles as particles moved through the chamber using multiple cameras mounted around the bubble chamber.\n",
    "- By analyzing the the radius of curvature of the bubbles, physicist could infer the momentum of individual particles.\n",
    "- Bubble chambers and the data they produce have allowed physicist to make some pretty incredible discoveries, such as **weak neutral currents** - [Nice video from 60 symbols](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=basLNz6frO8)"

    "- One issue with the bubble chamber was handling sheer volume of data it produced. \n",

    "- During this period, Hough began working on methods to automate the tedious task of detecting particle tracks in bubble chambers. [Fun Talk from Paul Hough on the bubble chamber](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/4805882).\n",
    "- One particularly difficult problem was detecting lines in images. \n",
    "- One evening walking home from work, Hough had an insight. He published his idea in a very confusing [1962 patent](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/9f/9f/f3/87610ddec32390/US3069654.pdf)."

Once you understand the core idea here, it's interesting to review how Hough presents it - patents are often dense a tough to follow like this, so spending a little time with Hough's patent is good practice!"
